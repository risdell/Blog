# Bayesian Single-season Occupancy Model using BLISS

This includes the dataset for a single-season occupancy model using the BLISS method ([Stuber et al. 2017)][1]. The data are pulled from a paper [(Isdell et al. 2014)][2] that previously implemented a single-season occupancy model using the `unmarked` package in R, and employed AIC to select a "best" scale for the spatial data and model averaging for the final model.
